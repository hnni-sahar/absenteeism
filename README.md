# Workplace Absenteeism Data Preprocessing

## Project Overview
This project is part of **The Data Analyst Course: Complete Data Analyst Bootcamp** on Udemy. The focus is on preprocessing a dataset related to absenteeism in the workplace. The preprocessing stage is crucial for ensuring clean and usable data before moving on to more advanced analysis techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains information on employees' absenteeism, including:
- **Reason for Absence**
- **Transportation Expense**
- **Distance to Work**
- **Age**
- **Daily Workload Average**
- **Body Mass Index**
- **Education**
- **Number of Children**
- **Number of Pets**
- **Absenteeism Time in Hours**

## Key Steps in Preprocessing
1. **Loading the dataset**: The CSV file is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values are identified and handled appropriately.
3. **Dropping Irrelevant Columns**: Unnecessary columns like `ID` are removed.
4. **Data Formatting**: Standardized the format of various fields (e.g., date and numerical data).
5. **Data Cleaning**: Ensured consistency and removed any anomalies from the dataset.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**: The project is written in Python.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For coding and visualization.

## Next Steps
The data has been successfully preprocessed and is ready for further analysis, including potential prediction models and insights generation.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pandas`, etc.).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to follow the data preprocessing steps.
